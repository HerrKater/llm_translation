# Multilingual Translation System for BrokerChooser
## Implementation and Evaluation Report

## 1. Introduction

This report summarizes my approach to developing a multilingual translation system using Large Language Models (LLMs) for BrokerChooser's web content. 
The objective was to create a Python application that translates financial content while maintaining accuracy, particularly with domain-specific terminology and preserving placeholder parameters.

## 2. Translation Quality Analysis

### 2.1 Baseline Translation Issues

I began by evaluating the provided Hungarian translations dataset to identify common issues. The analysis revealed several systematic problems:

| Issue Type | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Missing case suffixes | Hungarian requires location suffixes (-ban/-ben) with country names | "Elérhető [countryName]" instead of "Elérhető [countryName]-ban/ben" |
| Number formatting | Incorrect use of commas as thousand separators | "125,500" instead of "125 500" |
| Anglicisms | Direct borrowing of English terms | "appok" instead of "alkalmazások" |
| Unnatural word order | Syntactically correct but stylistically awkward | "Legjobb brókerek határidős ügyletekre" |
| Parameter handling | Inconsistent treatment of dynamic variables | Lack of suffix integration with [countryName] placeholders |
| Domain terminology | Inconsistent translation of financial terms | Varying translations for "broker," "fees," etc. |

### 2.2 Evaluation Metrics

I implemented a comprehensive scoring system with nine key metrics, each rated on a 1-5 scale:

1. **Accuracy**: Measures how accurately the translation conveys the original meaning
2. **Fluency**: Evaluates how naturally the translation reads in the target language
3. **Adequacy**: Assesses whether all information from the source text is preserved
4. **Consistency**: Measures the consistent use of terminology throughout translations
5. **Contextual Appropriateness**: Evaluates suitability for financial/investment context
6. **Terminology Accuracy**: Measures correct translation of domain-specific terms
7. **Readability**: Assesses clarity and ease of understanding
8. **Format Preservation**: Evaluates maintenance of original formatting, including numbers
9. **Error Rate**: Measures the absence of grammatical or typographical errors

### 2.3 Evaluation Results

The evaluation of the improved translations showed outstanding results across all metrics. Based on the provided data:

  - Proper handling of case suffixes for locations (e.g., "[countryName]-ban/ben")
  - Replacement of Anglicisms with proper Hungarian terms (e.g., "alkalmazások" instead of "appok")
  - More natural word ordering (e.g., "Legjobb határidős brókerek")
  - Consistent parameter handling with proper grammatical integration

## 3. Implementation Approach

### 3.1 Dual-Model Architecture

I implemented a dual-model system:
- **Translation Model**: Converts English source text to target languages
- **Evaluator Model**: Assesses translation quality using the defined metrics

This architecture allows for continuous improvement through a feedback loop where the evaluator model provides detailed assessment to enhance the translation model's prompts.

Using our evaluation framework, I identified which model-prompt-language combinations deliver acceptable results while managing costs effectively. 
This approach revealed a clear sweet spot between quality and expense across different language pairs. 
For languages with complex morphology or scripts like Hungarian, Japanese, and Arabic (Tier 1), larger models proved necessary to maintain quality. 
Languages with moderate complexity and specialized financial terminology such as German and French (Tier 2) performed well with medium-sized models.
Meanwhile, languages structurally closer to English like Spanish and Portuguese (Tier 3) achieved high-quality results with smaller, more cost-effective models. 
This tiered strategy optimizes translation costs based on three key factors: 
market potential (prioritizing languages with greater market size and growth in financial services), translation complexity (allocating appropriate model resources based on linguistic challenges), 
and cost efficiency (balancing comprehensive language coverage with computational expenses). By deploying models strategically according to these tiers,
I achieved consistent quality while optimizing resource allocation across BrokerChooser's multilingual content.

### 3.3 Model Selection Insights

The cost information from the evaluation data reveals that all translations were performed with the gpt-4o-mini model, with an average cost of approximately $0.001 per translation. 
This demonstrates that even smaller models can achieve high-quality translations when properly prompted, particularly for shorter financial texts.

The average token count was:
- Input tokens: ~3,580 per translation
- Output tokens: ~750 per translation

## 4. Future Improvements

Based on my findings, I recommend the following enhancements:

### 4.1 Parameter Preservation
One of the critical challenges is preserving parameters like [brokerName] or [countryName] while ensuring they integrated correctly with Hungarian grammar.

- Parameter detection and protection during pre-processing
- Special handling for agglutinative case endings with parameters (e.g., "[countryName]-ban/ben")
- Post-processing verification to ensure all parameters remain intact

### 4.2 Domain-Specific Terminology

To address financial terminology challenges, we could create:

- A financial domain lexicon specific to brokerage and investment platforms
- Contextual translation rules for terms with multiple possible translations
- Consistent approaches to handling industry-specific terminology


### 4.3 Financial Domain Training Dataset:
   - Create a specialized corpus of financial terminology for the investment sector
   - Develop country-specific regulatory and compliance term sets

### 4.4 Language-Specific Morphological Rules:
   - Implement pre-processing rules for Hungarian's complex case system
   - Develop parameter handling with proper grammatical integration

### 4.5 Cost-Optimized Model Selection:
   - Use the evaluation data to identify which translations can be handled by smaller models
   - Reserve larger models for complex languages and critical content

### 4.6 Continuous Learning Pipeline:
   - Implement a feedback mechanism to improve the system based on human review
   - Develop automated error pattern detection for ongoing refinement

### 4.7 Enhanced Context Handling:
   - Improve context awareness for ambiguous financial terms
   - Add website section awareness to ensure consistency across related pages

## 5. Conclusion

The implemented translation system demonstrates high performance for Hungarian financial content. The evaluation data confirms that with 
proper prompt engineering and domain-specific adaptation, even smaller models can produce high-quality translations that score perfectly across all quality metrics.
By using a strategic approach to language prioritization and model selection, BrokerChooser can efficiently scale its multilingual capabilities while maintaining optimal cost-quality balance.
The dual-model architecture allows for continuous improvement as the system processes more financial content across different languages.
